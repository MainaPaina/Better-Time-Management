            <h3>Terms of Service</h3>
            <p>
                Welcome to our app! By using this service, you agree to the following terms. If you don’t agree, well, you’re probably not reading this anyway.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>1. Acceptance of Terms:</strong> By using this app, you agree to these terms. If you don’t agree, please close the app and go outside. Fresh air is nice.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>2. Use of the Service:</strong> Use this app responsibly. No spamming, hacking, or trying to break the internet. We’re looking at you, keyboard warriors.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>3. Privacy:</strong> We value your privacy. That’s why we only collect the data you willingly give us. (And maybe a little extra, but only to make the app better, we promise!)
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>4. Intellectual Property:</strong> All the cool stuff in this app belongs to us. Please don’t steal it. We worked hard on this, and our lawyers are very good at their jobs.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>5. Limitation of Liability:</strong> If this app accidentally causes your coffee to spill or your cat to walk across your keyboard, we’re not responsible. Use at your own risk!
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>6. Changes to Terms:</strong> We may update these terms from time to time. When we do, we’ll let you know. Or maybe we won’t. It’s in the terms, after all.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>7. Contact Us:</strong> If you have any questions about these terms, feel free to contact us. But don’t expect a reply on weekends. We’re probably binge-watching something.
