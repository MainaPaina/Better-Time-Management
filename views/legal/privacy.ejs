           <p>By using our service, you agree to let us suggest how to spend your free time. Don't worry, it's for your own good! Also, remember that cookies are delicious, but sadly, ours are not edible. And finally, if something doesn't work as expected, it's not a bugâ€”it's a feature. Embrace the chaos!</p>
